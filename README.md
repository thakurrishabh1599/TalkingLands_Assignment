Task 1: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Scenario:
You are tasked with provisioning a basic web application stack in AWS using Terraform.
Requirements:
1. Deploy an EC2 instance running an Nginx server.
2. Use a security group to allow HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22) access.
3. The Nginx server should display a custom webpage with the text: "Deployed via Terraform."
4. Use variables to make the configuration reusable for different environments (e.g., dev, prod).
